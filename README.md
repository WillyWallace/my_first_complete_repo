# Readme

This is my test of a first complete repository on github testing status badges, sphinx for documentation on readthedocs, and testing workflow.

requirements.txt was created using:
```shell
pipreqs --force --mode gt
```

other commands for the sphinx workflow
```shell
sphinx-quickstart docs
```
and then answer the first question with 'no', leading to separated wource and build folders.
